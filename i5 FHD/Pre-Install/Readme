Hard Drive Partition Preparation
For Dual Booting with Windows it is reccommended to wipe the entire hard disk and contents and create partitions using diskutil in the OSX Installer.

Once OSX Install is booted:
1) a) For OSX only partition
    -open diskutil
    -delete all partitions
    -create OSX partition HFSJ+
   b) For Dual Booting OSX with Windows
    -open diskutil
    -delete all partitions
    -create OSX partition HFSJ+
    -create Windows partition HFSJ+
2) Install OSX to OSX partition
3) Reboot
4) Use Post-Install to run OSX

For Windows Install
1) Boot Windows Installer
2) Format/delete the HFSJ+ Windows partition you created in diskutil
3) Install Windows to that partition

NOTE: If the OSX installer freezes reboot and try again or remove any unnecessary kexts from the clover\kext\other folder
