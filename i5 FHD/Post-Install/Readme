We will add the clover folder to the EFI boot partition, install kexts and make Clover bootable from the hard drive.

Once OSX is booted:
1) Open Clover Configurator and mount EFI Boot drive.
2) Copy Clover folder into EFI drive
2) Install kexts from kexts\other to /s/l/e using kextwizard
3) Remove the installed kexts from your Clover folder
4) Reboot into Bios
5) Add Cloverx64.efi into Bios boot list
6) Save and exit

Clover should now be bootable from hard disk.
