# HackintoshXPS15
Dell XPS 15 9550 FHD Hackintosh
OSX El-Capitan 10.11.6

This git contains Clover folders and configurations for each state of readiness, Pre-Install, Post-Install and Finalised.

My specs are:
i7-6700HQ/HM170, 8GB RAM DDR4, NVIDIA 960M+Intel HD530, Dell Wireless 1830(BCM43602+BCM20703A1), 500GB M2 SSD Samsung 850 EVO

Reminder: This is for a FullHD, non-NVME XPS15 9550, adjust for your clover configuration accordingly.
